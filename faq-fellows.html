<p><strong>What kind of fellows are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p>We're looking for strong graduate (and advanced undergraduate) students with computational, quantitative, and analytics skills who care about making a social impact. Last year's fellows included people with Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Economics, Applied Math, Physics, Linguistics, Sociology, and Public Policy degrees</p>


<p><strong>When does the fellowship start and finish?</strong></p>
<p>We'll start end of May and finish end of August. We're working on figuring out multiple start dates that can accomodate different end of quarter/semester dates</p>

<p><strong>Is it a full-time program and do I have to be in Chicago?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Is it a paid fellowship and do you provide housing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we provide stipends based on your degree that are comparable to internship programs. Housing is also provided for the summer.</p>


<p><strong>Do I have to be a student to apply?</strong></p>
<p>Not neccesarily but this is designed for current student or recent graduates.
If you have finished a degree (undergrad, Masters, Phd) in the past couple of years, you should be ok to apply.</p>

<p><strong>When do I hear back from the fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>We'll review applications starting February 1 and will schedule interviews after we go through a round of reviewing. Final decisions will be sent out by March 15.
</p>

<p><strong>What projects am I going to be working on?</strong></p>
<p>Call for Projects is still on-going. You can see projects from last year <a href="projects/">here</a>. Projects will be in partnership with government and non profit organizations and will be in areas of 
 education, healthcare, energy, community development, disaster relief, and public safety. We'll send out a specific list of projects with our decision by March 15.
