project: Improving Social Services Interactions

Medicine by itself cannot always provide us with health. If a sick child lives in a mold-infested house, asthma medication will only do so much. Medical issues are caused, prolonged, or exacerbated by lack of access to basic human needs such as food, transportation, or social services.
 
**Health Leads** envisions a healthcare system in which all patients’ basic resource needs are addressed as a standard part of quality care. In the clinics where they operate, physicians and other providers can prescribe food, heat, and other basic resources their patients need to be healthy, alongside prescriptions for medication. Health Leads advocates then help families navigate the complex social services landscape and provide ongoing support with frequent follow-up calls, text messages, emails, and research.

However, maintaining relationships with patients who live in an unstable environment presents a unique challenge for Health Leads. This summer, we will help them improve sustained engagement, determining why some clients are actively engaged, why others disengage, and what effective strategies Health Leads can pursue.  Using the organization's client engagement data, service provider data, and patient demographics, the DSSG team will find effective ways to reduce the dropout rate and increase responsiveness, exploring different methods of communication. By discovering strategies to improve patient responsiveness, the project will help Health Leads advocates strengthen their relationship with clients and ensure that the most needed resources are effectively delivered.
