**Background**:

The University of Chicago launched the [Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](http://dssg.uchicago.edu) in 2013 to give aspiring data scientists the opportunities, skills, and experience to tackle problems with social impact. In the first year of the program, approximately 600 applicants--graduate students and advanced undergraduates with backgrounds in Computer Science, Statistics, Economics, and Public Policy from 200 universities around the world--competed for 36 fellow positions. The selected fellows worked together with experienced mentors on projects in areas such as education, health care, energy, disaster relief, city services, transportation, and public safety.

In addition to training a highly-skilled corps of socially conscious data scientists, the fellowship is designed to increase the analytical capacity of non-profits and government organizations. Both the fellows and the project partners gain experience working on data and analytics related problems, using and building open-source software and analytical tools, and prototyping solutions to real-world problems.

Project partners such as non-profits and government organizations are critical to this program. **We are seeking partners for Summer 2014, with the possibility of a longer-term collaboration**. If your organization would like to be part of the Summer 2014 fellowship, please follow the guidelines detailed below. 

Ideal project partners have

1. an interesting problem that can be tackled using data/analytics

2. a willingness to engage with the fellows on a regular basis

3. the ability to use the fellows’ solution to make a meaningful social impact.


**If you think your organization would be a good fit for the Summer 2014 Fellowship, please follow the instructions below to submit a project proposal**. If you know of any organizations that would benefit from being a project partner with Data Science for Social Good, please forward this call for projects along to them.

**DSSG Project Proposal Guidelines:**

Proposals should contain a brief problem description, and should address each of the following requirements:

-	**Relevant Problem**: The project should relate to an issue that has a broad social impact.

-	**Data Can Help**: There should be a clear way in which analytics and technology can help address the identified problem.

-	**Access to Data**: The partner should be willing to allow the University of Chicago to access the relevant data, either remotely (using the partner organization’s computing resources) or on secure servers at the university.

-	**Access to Experts**: The partner should be willing to dedicate time to discussing the problem and potential solutions with the fellows, explaining the data, and answering questions--particularly at the beginning of the fellowship, but continuing throughout.

-	**Post-Fellowship Usage**: Partners should identify a path for using the fellows’ work and/or developing it further.

In some cases, it may be possible to start collaborative work on a problem before the fellowship begins, and/or to continue work after the summer. Therefore, if you have a proposal for a longer-term project that may not fit in a three-month program, feel free to discuss it in your proposal.

**Deadlines:**

Initial Expression of Interest: December 10, 2013

Initial Response from us: January 5, 2014

Formal Proposal Deadline: February 1, 2014

Final Decisions: March 1, 2014

### <center>Past Projects:</center>

The summer 2013 fellows worked on over a dozen projects, details of which are available at http://dssg.uchicago.edu. Some examples of partners and corresponding projects include:

**Mesa Public School District**:	Help the Mesa (Arizona) Public Schools identify students with the potential to go to college and graduate, but who are likely to apply to colleges--if any--that are far below their potential. These students will be provided additional support to enroll in college, seek financial aid, and embark on a fulfilling career.

**City of Chicago**:	Work together with city agencies such as the Department of Streets and Sanitation to evaluate the impact of service changes, and to optimize service delivery for quality and efficiency.

**Northshore Hospital**: Use clinical and lab data to better predict cardiac and respiratory arrest (Code Blue). This helps doctors identify at-risk patients and attend to them earlier.

**Chicago Transit Authority**:	Use individual-level public transit usage data to simulate crowding on Chicago bus routes, and to prototype a system that helps predict the impact of schedule changes.

**[Ushahidi](http://www.ushahidi.com/)**: Help scale up the Ushahidi Open Source Crowdsourcing platform, which gathers information about disasters and other important events from SMS messages, emails, tweets, etc., by automating aspects of the data extraction process. 

**Nurse Family Partnership**: Use non-experimental data to estimate the effectiveness of the NFP Nurse Home Visitation program at improving outcomes for newborns (e.g., immunization and breast-feeding rates).
